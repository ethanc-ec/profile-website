A Data Science major at Boston Univeristy.

# [Project 1: Boston University Class, Credit, and Section Searcher](https://github.com/ethanc-ec/ScheduleHub)
* Created a tool that uses a text based interface to:
  * Check the information about a class
  * See the Hub credits and numerical credits each class gives
  * Check for the available sections/times for lectures and labs/discussions
* Used various packages to scrape information from Boston Universityâ€™s  course websites
* Cleaned scraped information, then sorted and stored it in a persistent storage file
* Deployed performance changes using persistent storage that reduced process time by up to 99%
* Used GitHub to automatically run unit tests and test compatibility on Linux and Windows
