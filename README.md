    <dt>- Created a tool that uses a text based interface to:</dt>
     <dd>Check the information about a class </dd>
     <dd>See the Hub credits and numerical credits each class gives</dd>
     <dd>Check for the available sections/times for lectures and labs/discussions</dd>
    <dt>Used various packages to scrape information from Boston Universityâ€™s  course websites</dt>
* Cleaned scraped information, then sorted and stored it in a persistent storage file
* Deployed performance changes using persistent storage that reduced process time by up to 99%
* Used GitHub to automatically run unit tests and test compatibility on Linux and Windows
